# Flyer Arranger

**Purpose:** To make printing an A5 flyer on A4 paper dead simple.

**How-To:**

1. Visit: https://kenanhanke.github.io/flyer-arranger/

2. Upload a PDF containing either one or two pages in A5 paper size

3. Click on convert and download the resulting PDF

5. Print using duplex and long edge binding on A4 paper (usually the default settings)

6. Cut the sheets of A4 paper in half using a paper cutter

7. Now you have a bunch of flyers in A5 paper size as if you had printed your original PDF on A5 paper directly âœ¨
